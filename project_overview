# 5 A Side Organiser

## What is the Application?

An all-in-one application for football organisers and players alike which allows all parties involved to provide and access the necessary information around the setup of a football game in one location.

## Why is this Necessary

Organising a game of football between friends should be a care free process, however this is not the case in my experience. A system reliant on on dms, group chats or even word of mouth provides so many issues for the organiser and there is little in the way of tracking or consistency. Confusion around game dates/times, who is going to the games and paying for the games are some of the biggest problems that have risen from my personal 5-a-side that could be eliminated with the correct application. So why not aim for a way to gather all the information one needs and display it in a concise and user friendly way to make organising less of a hassel and reduce confusion of the players within the group?
